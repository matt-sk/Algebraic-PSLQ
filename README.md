# Algebraic PSLQ

An implementation, in *Maple*, of Algebraic PSLQ (or APSLQ): an extension of the PSLQ integer relation finding algorithm to finding relations of algebraic integers for certain complex quadratic extension fields.
This repository contains both an implementation of the extended algorithm, as well as code to perform (and results of) experimental mathematical testing of the algorithm as published by the author.

## Implementation
The implementation of the algorithm is written in *Maple*.
The Master branch (this branch) contains the implementation only.
The [Testing](https://github.com/matt-sk/Algebraic-PSLQ/tree/Testing) branch contains the same implementation, the scripts used to perform the testing, and the results of that testing.

## Published Results
The results of testing are published in:

* *“Extending the PSLQ Algorithm to Algebraic Integer Relations”* to be published in the Jon Borwein Commemorative Conference proceedings. ([arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06063))
* My (yet to be completed) PhD thesis.

The specific commits corresponding to the published results will be tagged appropriately.
